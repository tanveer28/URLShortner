This is the URL shortner app I created

You will need to run the sln in visual studio.
This is the server that the front end will talk to.

For the front end, navigate to .\URLShortner\url-shortner

Then run 'npm install' to install the necessay node modules

Then run 'npm start' to start the front end

It should open a new browser to http://localhost:3000/

You can enter a URL in the first text box and it will give you a "short" url

You can use that short url in your browser and it should take you to the webpage, as long as the API is running in the background.
